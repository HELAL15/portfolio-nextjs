# Personal Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website built with modern web technologies to showcase my skills and projects as a front-end developer. The project is created using **Next.js** for server-side rendering and static site generation, **Tailwind CSS** for efficient styling, and **Framer Motion** for smooth animations. I integrated **Sentry** for error tracking and monitoring, ensuring the siteâ€™s performance and reliability. Additionally, **Three.js** is utilized to add interactive 3D elements, providing a visually engaging user experience.

## Tech Stack

- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.

Feel free to explore and see how I bring together these technologies to create a fast, responsive, and engaging web experience.
